# A Blog-Post Application in Flask
This is a blog-post application developed using a Python framework called Flask.
Users register(create accounts), log in to create posts, comment on them and optionally edit or delete them.
It is incredibly important to note that this application is not a typical up-to-standard real-world one, it is only meant to demonstrate my backend development skills.
The website folder is the one that holds the files of this project whereas the app.py is for running the application.

The __init__.py file is our application factory.
The models.py file contains our database models.
The views.py file has the code for rendering the views/web pages of the application.
The auth.py file has the code logic for user authentication and verification.
And last but not least templates folder contains the HTML templates that actually display stuff on the browser.
